# Introduction:
<p1>One of the biggest challenges facing companies trying to expand and develop in the present competitive business climate is finding and employing competent personnel. However, a lot of businesses struggle to hire top people fast because their hiring processes are cumbersome and slow. These inefficiencies have far-reaching effects, such as prolonged job vacancies, higher costs, and the potential loss of exceptional individuals to more astute competitors. In this ever-changing business environment, businesses seeking to maintain growth and a competitive edge must prioritise streamlining their hiring procedures. The foundation for a deeper analysis of the subtleties of contemporary hiring practices and the need for companies to streamline their hiring procedures is laid out in this introduction. </p1>


# Solution:
<p2> For this solution to the problem, I created a website. This website is used only for hiring managers and talent agencies. When a talent comes to my website and signs in, they ask to submit the data of the candidate and job description. My website then analyzes the given data set and the job description, generates new data with the given matched job description with best match accuracy. if the data is OK, then it asks the hiring manager to give how many rounds they want to conduct.


There are two main options to ask for an interview: either one round of hiring managers to select for the online assessment round or the second round of coding round.

If the hiring manager selects the first round for an online assessment, the second round will be a coding round; otherwise, the second round will be an assessment round with questions.


After taking input from the hiring manager, my website sends mail to all selected candidates and can date the first round. After the first round my application will send  the performance of candidates to the hiring manager with a graph, then the  shotlisted candidates will be seclected  for the next round according to  filter. the second email will be sended to the selected candidates for the coding round, to conduct the next  round, and send the data of selected candidate performance to the hiring manager with a graph.


After the hiring manager checks, they will select the candidate on their performance . This is how my website will work,
and this will help the hiring manager reduce the time spent  to selecting the best candidate for the company, and it will help to find the best candidate.</p2>
